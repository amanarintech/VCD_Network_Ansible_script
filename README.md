# VMware Cloud Director (vCD) Network Automation using Ansible

This repository contains Ansible playbooks to automate the creation of different types of VDC networks in VMware Cloud Director, including:

- Routed Network
- Imported Network (DV Port Group or NSX-T Segment)
- Direct Network
- Isolated Network

---

## üìÅ Playbooks

| Playbook File         | Description                                |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| `routed.yml`          | Creates a routed VDC network with IPv4/IPv6 support |
| `imported.yml`        | Imports an existing NSX-T segment or DV port group into VCD |
| `direct.yml`          | Creates a direct network connected to a specific edge gateway |
| `isolated.yml`        | Creates a fully isolated network in the VDC |

---

## üöÄ Routed Network - `routed.yml`

This playbook automates the creation of a **NAT Routed VDC Network** with optional **dual-stack (IPv4 + IPv6)** support.

### üîß Variables to Configure

```yaml
vcd_api_host_name: ""               # vCD API hostname (e.g., vcloud.example.com)
vcd_api_version: "36.3"            # API version
vcd_api_token: ""                  # API token for authentication
vcd_organization_name: ""          # Org name in vCD
vcd_organization_vdc_name: ""      # VDC name in vCD
edge_connection_name: ""           # Name of edge gateway for NAT routing

network_name: ""                   # Desired network name
network_description: ""            # Description
enable_dual_subnet_network: true   # Enable both IPv4 and IPv6

# IPv4 subnet config
Gateway_CIDR_IPv4: "192.168.100.1"
ipv4_prefix_length: 24
ipv4_ip_ranges_string: "192.168.100.10-192.168.100.20"

# IPv6 subnet config
Gateway_CIDR_IPv6: "fd00:192:168:1::1"
ipv6_prefix_length: 64
ipv6_ip_ranges_string: "fd00:192:168:1::10-fd00:192:168:1::20"

# DNS settings
ipv4_dns_suffix: "example.com"
ipv4_dns_server1: "8.8.8.8"
ipv4_dns_server2: "1.1.1.1"






üõ°Ô∏è Isolated Network - isolated.yml
This playbook creates a fully isolated VDC network in VMware Cloud Director (vCD). It is not connected to any edge gateway, making it suitable for internal-only communication between VMs.

vcd_api_host_name: ""               # vCD API hostname
vcd_api_version: "36.3"            # API version
vcd_api_token: ""                  # API token for authentication
vcd_organization_name: ""          # Org name in vCD
vcd_organization_id: ""            # Org ID (can be fetched via API)
vcd_organization_vdc_name: ""      # VDC name
vcd_organization_vdc_id: ""        # VDC ID (can be fetched via API)

backing_network_id: ""             # NSX-T Segment backing ID (can be blank for new)

network_name: ""                   # Desired network name
network_description: ""            # Description
enable_dual_subnet_network: false  # Set to true for IPv6 support

# IPv4 subnet config
Gateway_CIDR_IPv4: "172.20.30.1"
ipv4_prefix_length: 24
ipv4_ip_ranges_string: "172.20.30.10-172.20.30.20"

# IPv6 subnet config
Gateway_CIDR_IPv6: "fd00:172:20:30::1"
ipv6_prefix_length: 64
ipv6_ip_ranges_string: "fd00:172:20:30::10-fd00:172:20:30::20"

# DNS settings
ipv4_dns_suffix: "example.com"
ipv4_dns_server1: "8.8.8.8"
ipv4_dns_server2: "1.1.1.1"



üåê Direct Network - direct.yml
This playbook creates a Direct VDC Network in VMware Cloud Director. It connects the VDC directly to an existing external network (such as a DV Port Group), enabling VM-level access to external networks without NAT or routing via an edge gateway.

üîß Variables to Configure
vcd_api_host_name: ""               # vCD API hostname
vcd_api_version: "36.3"            # API version
vcd_api_token: ""                  # API token for authentication

vcd_organization_name: ""          # vCD Organization name
vcd_organization_vdc_name: ""      # VDC name

external_network: ""               # Name of the external network to attach
network_name: ""                   # Name of the new direct network
network_description: ""            # Network description
shared_network: "true"             # Should the network be shared (string: "true"/"false")



üîÅ Imported Network - imported.yml
This playbook creates an Imported VDC Network in VMware Cloud Director using an available Distributed Virtual Port Group (DV PortGroup) from a registered vCenter (VIM server). It supports both IPv4 and IPv6 subnets.

üîß Required Variables
vcd_api_host_name: ""               # vCloud Director hostname
vcd_api_version: "36.3"            # API version
vcd_api_token: ""                  # API refresh token

vcd_organization_name: ""          # vCD Organization name
vcd_organization_vdc_name: ""      # VDC name
vim_server_id: ""                  # VIM Server (vCenter) ID

network_name: ""                   # New network name
network_description: ""            # Description
shared_network: "false"            # "true"/"false" string

# IPv4 settings
Gateway_CIDR_IPv4: "192.168.150.1"

ipv4_dns_server1: ""
ipv4_dns_server2: ""

# IPv6 settings
Gateway_CIDR_IPv6: "fd00:192:168:1::1"
ipv6_prefix_length: 64
ipv6_ip_ranges_string: "fd00:192:168:1::10-fd00:192:168:1::20"
